#
This project involves constructing an LSTM time series machine learning model to predict stock prices. The goal is to assess the accuracy of the model in predicting stock prices.
# 
I constructed an 97.52% accurate LSTM model with 4 layers of neurons.
#
I successfully extracted 2110 days of trading prices for 20 stocks randomly sampled from the S&P 500, trained the model using 32560 data points, and tested the model using 9640 data points.
