This project involves constructing an LSTM time series machine learning model to predict stock prices. The goal is to assess the accuracy of the model in predicting stock prices.
#
I was able to extract 2110 days of trading prices for 20 stocks randomly sampled from the S&P 500, train the model using 32560 data points, test the model using 9640 data points. Overall, my LSTM model is 97.52% accurate.
